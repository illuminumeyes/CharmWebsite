        <h1>CHARM</h1>
        <h2>CHARM, the Community for Holistic, Accessible, Rights Based Mental Health was launched in September 2020.
            <br>
            <br>
            We established CHARM as a society, following the concerns that we raised about the lack of meaningful
            consultation and co-production that took place regarding the re-development of Park House as a single site
            psychiatric hospital.
            <br>
            <br>
            We are a campaign calling for radical changes in the way psychiatric services are provided in Manchester.
            We’ve teamed up with people with lived experience, trade unions, family groups and citizens to challenge the
            Greater Manchester Mental Health Trust decisions to build a large psychiatric hospital in Crumpsall.
