        <h2> Our History</h2>
        <p>CHARM, the Community for Holistic, Accessible, Rights Based Mental Health was launched in September 2020.
            <br />
            We established CHARM as a society, following the concerns that we raised about the lack of meaningful
            consultation and co-production that took place regarding the re-development of Park House as a single site
            psychiatric hospital.
            <br />
            CHARM Projects CIC was established in October 2022 in order to conduct research and community development
            projects to further our central values of compassion, community, human rights and holistic approaches to
            mental health.
            <br />
            We are a campaign calling for radical changes in the way psychiatric services are provided in Manchester.
            We’ve teamed up with people with lived experience, trade unions, family groups and citizens to challenge the
            Greater Manchester Mental Health Trust decisions to build a large psychiatric hospital in Crumpsall.
            <br />
            The campaign was launched after we wrote a letter to Andy Burnham to meeting discuss the future of mental
            health services in July 2020. We’ve now met with Andy twice and we are seeking his support for a root and
            branch review and an action plan to transform mental health services.
            We analysed the situation in Greater Manchester and reflected on the policy changes that are currently being
            addressed by the Department of Health including: <a

                rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Community Mental Health Framework for Adults
                and Older Adults;</a>

                target="_blank">Mental Health Bill 2022;</a> and
            <a href="https://www.longtermplan.nhs.uk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> the Long Term NHS Plan</a>.
            <br />
            In our experience Manchester’s mental health services have been constructed around biological understandings
            of illness for far too long. The best efforts of our mental health workers and services are compromised by
            the narrow focus on illnesses and medical responses of our crisis services.
            This mindset eclipses the significance of social determinants on peoples’ lives. It places the emphasis on
            disease processes rather than racism; social-economic adversity; people fleeing persecution; homelessness
            and poor housing; adverse childhood events; trauma; oppression; micro-aggressions; toxic situations and
            relationships.
            These we know are amongst the most significant contributors to undermining our well-being and resilience,
            leading to poor mental health.
            This is what needs to be addressed.
            <br />
            Our values and demands are not new ones. Many of these demands for justice and rights were made in the
            1980s, we know because many of us were there. Nearly 30 years later, how much longer must we wait for
            change? (See

            CHARM Society established CHARM Projects Community Interest Company (CIC) in October 2022, which aims to
            support the debates and discussions about the future of mental health care in Manchester.
            <br />
            Our priority is to bring best international practise to Manchester through education, research and community
            engagement.
            <br />
            We aim to work in a collaborative way with experts by experience and experts by profession in the interests
            of our diverse communities.
            Additionally, we are keen to foster collaborations with partners locally, nationally and internationally.

                        community
                        and address inequalities in mental health care.</li>
                    <li>The essential role of families, friends and social networks is recognised as integral to
                        community
                        support and must be fully supported by services.</li>

                        long term relational support.</li>

                        and circumstances.</li>
                    <li>The diagnoses used within psychiatric services should be acknowledged as constructed and not the
                        evidence of a ‘disease’. We recognise that diagnoses are currently necessary to access benefits

                        services.</li>
                    <li>A recognition that a person’s beliefs, spirituality or faith are deeply held convictions and
                        must be
                        respected and responded to, particularly during periods of crisis or challenge. This can be an
                        important
                        part of people’s self-defined recovery.</li>
                    <li>Services should focus on understanding distress as relational and seek to enable people to find
                        meaning
                        in their experiences alongside their families and social networks.</li>

                    <li>Long term use of high dose medication is dangerous and life shortening, therefore people should
                        be

            <div class="description">
                <p>We recognise that there are multiple and interacting factors linked to mental distress and trauma.
                    Social determinants such as poverty, homelessness, racism, patriarchy, sexual abuse, war and
                    torture, are key factors underpinning many people’s shaping of mental distress. As such we need a
                    service that holds at its core a system of compassionate care that recognises distress as a societal
                    responsibility.</p>
